SearchABS is a lightweight, RESTful web application which communicates RESTfully with ABS.Stat. We take your query and try to match it the data available in ABS.Stat and make some good "guesses" when trying to deliver an answer. The application is built using Java, hosted on JBOS and returns a JSON result which is displayed using jQuery in HTML.
